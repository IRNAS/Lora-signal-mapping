## Sender

This is the code for the sender part of this project.

The sender has a shield, which is populated by LoRa and a GPS module.

First it gets the GPS data (float) and sends it through the LoRa system to the receiver.

It is also reading input from the receiver, to know its status (success transfer or not)
